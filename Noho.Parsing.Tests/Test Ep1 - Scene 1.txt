Ravenheart Hospital, Charm City

Regarded by many as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, hospital in the world.

As you walk up the steps into the entrance hallway, you are still taken aback at the hospital’s architectural magnificence.

The tall columns make you think of the magnitude of importance of the field of medicine and those who came before you.

The large glass windows make you reflect on the importance of your life and the lives you help save every day.

You know deep down that a hospital is a place of healing, but its appearance and legacy are still intimidating...

Especially for your first week on the job.

No better way to start the morning off than with some tea, wouldn’t you say?

*ANNABEL, curious
It’s gotta be around here, somewhere...

*ANNABEL, victory
TA-DA!

*NARRATOR
Annabel procures a small cardboard box with the picture of a sleeping red dragon on it.
The label reads “Red Dragon Green Tea: Awaken the Dragon Inside!”

*ANNABEL, happy
A little green tea in the morning gets me charged up for the rest of the day.

What about you, doctor, do you prefer tea or coffee in the morning?

I’m sure you’re well aware of the nutritional effects of green tea.

There has been some scientific studies showing that green tea improves concentration and lower risk of cancer and other diseases!

Coffee. Black.

How sophisticated.

There has been some scientific studies showing that black coffee may help prevent some diseases and lower your risk of type 2 diabetes.

It also prevents me from falling asleep during operations.

You better not say things like that to our patients!

*PROTAG, laughing
I chug a Bull Rush energy drink first thing in the morning.

*ANNABEL, scolding
You’re supposed to be a doctor!
That’s super unhealthy! Don’t joke about things like that!

*ANNABEL, calm
You should really consider an alternative, like green tea!

There has been some scientific studies showing that green tea improves concentration and lower risk of cancer and other diseases!

*PROTAG, confused
So… 

*PROTAG, smug
...is that a no on getting a Bull Rush?

Don’t sass me.

Actually, I only drink water.
