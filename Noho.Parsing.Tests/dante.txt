*NARRATOR
RavenHeart Hospital, Evening


You were called to go to the Hospital Garage, immediately. Emergency Medical Services are required.


You approach a young man standing in front of a sleek and modern ambulance, nothing like the big, box-shaped wagons you are familiar with.


There is a holographic flame decal that runs along the front and the sides of the ambulance like something out of a cheesy action movie.


*DANTE, 4
Are you ready, rookie? Clock’s tickin’.


*PROTAG, 2

*PROTAG, concerned
I think so.


*DANTE, grumpy
Well, wake up scrub! This is the real deal.

*PROTAG, serious
I was born ready.
*LOVE: 2


*DANTE, happy
That’s what I’m talkin’ about!
*END_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
*PROTAG, snarky
Are you ready?


*DANTE, unimpressed
I bet you thought that sounded cool in your head.

*PROTAG
Semper Paratus.
*LOVE: 1


*DANTE, laughing
This ain’t the Coast Guard, but I suppose close enough: we are in the business of saving lives.

*NARRATOR
Dante pats the top of the Inferno lovingly and climbs inside.You get into the passenger seat and lock into the seatbelt harness. It feels like strapping into a race car.


*DANTE, intrigued
Holiday was making a fuss over the new recruit. So let’s see whatcha’ got!


*NARRATOR
Dante presses several buttons and the console display of the vehicle lights up. Your heart jolts as the sudden volume of sound hits your ears. The lights on the dashboard pulse with the pounding bass of Eurobeat. 


Dante pulls the stick shift into gear, and peels out of the Hospital’s garage. A hologram of a 3D map of the city appears on the dashboard with the route highlighted with a glowing line.


*DANTE
Pretty cool, right?


*NARRATOR
Dante doesn’t wait for you to answer. He reaches up to grab a radio microphone, clicks the button in with his thumb and begins talking to you, even though you are only several inches apart.


*DANTE
Alright, rookie, here’s the situation. There’s been a fight at “Hot Shots,” a local bar. Some say that place is haunted. Or cursed. Maybe both… 


Anyway, two victims have been identified for us to handle, but could be more. You never know with things like this, there may be others who got hurt. It was a bar fight, after all.


Expect broken glass. Lacerations. Possibly broken bones. We’ll see soon enough, so keep your eyes peeled.


*NARRATOR
Dante fluidly adjusts gears while driving at breakneck speed, weaving between cars and trucks on the busy highway. Dante steals a glance your way amidst the chaos of the road.


*DANTE
You look like you got something on your mind. What’s up?


*ACTION_CHOICE, 3
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
Why was there a fight?


*DANTE
I dunno. The cops are on their way to deal with that. It's not really our problem. We don’t cuff ‘em, we fix ‘em. That’s it.
        *END_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
                What kind of injuries should we expect?

        *END_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
                Haunted? Like ghosts?
*LOVE: 1


                *DANTE
It's old and run down so it could just be squeaky floorboards. But it might be more. Fun to think about, right?
        *END_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
                Nothing. I’m ready.
*LOVE: 1


*DANTE
Good, I was starting to get bored.

The wheels screech as Dante slams on the breaks.

Alright, we’re here.

*CUTSCENE
*BGM: Street
*BG: STREET


*NARRATOR
You see a restless crowd gathered in front of the bar, lit by the neon sign of the bar. Dante raises his voice over the commotion and pushes his way through.


*DANTE, angry, 4
Outta the way! Paramedics coming through! 


*DANTE, confused
Rookie? Where the hell are you?


*PROTAG, 2
*ACTION_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
*PROTAG
Push through the crowd.


*NARRATOR
You push your way through the crowd in an attempt to catch up and bump into a major beefcake. They do not seem to notice, but are blocking your way.
        *END_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG
                Look for an opening.


                *NARRATOR
You look for a break in the crowd to slip by. The crowd keeps shuffling making it hard to find an opening.


*LOVE: -1


*DANTE, angry
Umm, hello? We gotta job to do here!


*NARRATOR
At Dante’s urging, you start to push through the crowd and bump into a major beefcake. They do not seem to notice, but are blocking your way.

                *PROTAG, scared
Excuse me. I need to get through.


*NARRATOR
The imposing figure does not seem to hear you. Suddenly an arm reaches out of the crowd and grabs onto your lapel and pulls you forward.


*DANTE, angry
What the hell are you doing? We got to get working and fast!
*LOVE: -1


*NARRATOR
Dante returns to two men lying on the ground. They appear to be bleeding.
        *END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
                *PROTAG, angry
Move it or lose it pal!


*NARRATOR
The imposing figure turns slowly towards you, eyes bulging in anger. They notice your medical gear and step aside, eyes locked onto you.


You approach Dante who is kneeling next to two men lying on the ground. They appear to be bleeding.

*VICTIMS: 2


*DANTE, 5
Looks like these two chuckleheads decided to try out for MMA after putting back a few too many.


One has a broken arm and both are suffering from lacerations. Broken glass is embedded in their arms.


Let’s patch ‘em up quick and bring them back to the hospital for further treatment.

Remember how I said some people think “Hot Shots” is haunted? You don’t like… believe in ghosts or anything, do you?

                *PROTAG
                No. Definitely not.


                *LOVE: -1


                *DANTE, embarrassed
Uh, no! Duh! Of course not! I was just seeing if you were a scaredy baby.

                *PROTAG, curious
                They could be. Who knows?


                *LOVE: 1


                *DANTE, surprised
Really? Yeah, me too. How could you really know for sure?


*DANTE, curious
I mean, it's neat to think about if ghosts do exist. Like, what’s their deal? Why do some people become ghosts and others don’t?
        *END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
                *PROTAG, serious
                Ghosts are absolutely real.


                *PROTAG
                In fact, I’m pretty sure I’ve seen one before.


                *LOVE: 2


                *DANTE, surprised
                Woah! You’ve seen a ghost before? Holy crap!


                *DANTE, curious
What did it look like? Was it like a floating sheet or a little transparent Casper-thing or an old spooky lady with empty eye sockets?


*PROTAG, smug
I think you’ll need to see one for yourself.


*DANTE, happy
Oh yeah, I think you’re right!
        *END_CHOICE
        *CHOICE
                *PROTAG, neutral
I am, in fact, a ghost.


                *LOVE: 1


                *DANTE, laughing
You’ve been a ghost this whole time and didn’t tell me?


*PROTAG
It’s like the Sixth Sense: you were supposed to find out at the end of the story, but you gone and screwed it all up!


*DANTE, neutral
Before this revelation, as a paramedic, the phrase “I see dead people,” used to have a different meaning.
