These big ulcers are a doozy, but I know you got this, partner!

All ya gotta do is excise, patch, and sterilize.

To excise, use the MEDIGEL and cut around the ulcers with the SCALPEL. Then use the FORCEPS to remove the ulcer.

Afterwards, BANDAGE the wound and sterilize it with MEDIGEL.

MEDIGEL, SCALPEL, FORCEPS, BANDAGE, and then MEDIGEL. Right.
