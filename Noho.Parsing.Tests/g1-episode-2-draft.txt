*NARRATOR
Ravenheart Hospital, Charm City


Regarded by many as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, hospital in the world.


As you walk up the steps into the entrance hallway, you are still taken aback at the hospital’s architectural magnificence.


The tall columns make you think of the magnitude of importance of the field of medicine and those who came before you.


The large glass windows make you reflect on the importance of your life and the lives you help save every day.


You know deep down that a hospital is a place of healing, but its appearance and legacy are still intimidating...


Especially for your first week on the job.


*BG: Hospital_Breakroom


*NARRATOR
Ravenheart Hospital, 2F Breakroom
08:24 AM


As you make your way into the breakroom, you see your coworker Annabel Lee.


She’s sitting down and watching the local morning news on a large, wall mounted television set.


News Anchor: It’s another beautiful summer morning in Charm City with a low chance of rain in the late afternoon...


*ANNABEL, 2, happy
Good morning, PROTAG. 
Nice summer weather we’re having, yes?


*PROTAG, 4

*PROTAG, calm
Indeed.


*ANNABEL, calm
Always the strong, silent type.
*END_CHOICE

*PROTAG, neutral
I miss the snow, to be honest.


*ANNABEL, calm
Snow is beautiful but the changing seasons are refreshing.

*PROTAG, happy
Every day in Charm City is a beautiful day.


*ANNABEL, laugh
Oh, doctor. Always a charmer!
*END_CHOICE

*PROTAG, laugh
I can’t wait to hit the beach!


*ANNABEL, laugh
Oh, doctor! You’re so excitable!


*ANNABEL, calm
My husband and I are planning to take the kids to the beach this weekend.
It’ll be a nice relaxing time, for sure!


*PROTAG
That sounds like fun!

*PROTAG, neutral
*ANNABEL, neutral
No better way to start the morning off than with some tea, wouldn’t you say?


*NARRATOR
Annabel starts rummaging around the drawers for packets of tea.


*ANNABEL, curious
It’s gotta be around here, somewhere...


*ANNABEL, victory
TA-DA!


*NARRATOR
Annabel procures a small cardboard box with the picture of a sleeping red dragon on it.
The label reads “Red Dragon Green Tea: Awaken the Dragon Inside!”


*ANNABEL, happy
A little green tea in the morning gets me charged up for the rest of the day.


*ANNABEL, neutral
What about you, doctor, do you prefer tea or coffee in the morning?


*ACTION_CHOICE
*CHOICE
*PROTAG, happy
I drink tea as well.


*ANNABEL, happy
I’m sure you’re well aware of the nutritional effects of green tea.


*NARRATOR
Annabel excitedly pours you a cup of “Red Dragon Green Tea” and hands it to you gently.


*ANNABEL
There has been some scientific studies showing that green tea improves concentration and lower risk of cancer and other diseases!


*PROTAG
Well, if it’s good enough for dragons, it's good enough for me!


*ANNABEL, laughing
That’s right!
*END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
*PROTAG, calm
Coffee. Black.


*ANNABEL, laughing
How sophisticated. 


*NARRATOR
Annabel pours you a cup of coffee from the coffee maker. 
Its powerful aroma fills the room.


*ANNABEL
There has been some scientific studies showing that black coffee may help prevent some diseases and lower your risk of type 2 diabetes.


*PROTAG, smug
It also prevents me from falling asleep during operations.


*ANNABEL, scolding
You better not say things like that to our patients!
*END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
*PROTAG, laughing
I chug a Bull Rush energy drink first thing in the morning.


*ANNABEL, scolding
You’re supposed to be a doctor!
That’s super unhealthy! Don’t joke about things like that!


*ANNABEL, calm
You should really consider an alternative, like green tea!


There has been some scientific studies showing that green tea improves concentration and lower risk of cancer and other diseases!


*PROTAG, confused
So… 


*PROTAG, smug
...is that a no on getting a Bull Rush?


*NARRATOR
Annabel ignores you and hands you a cup of green tea.


*ANNABEL, scolding
Don’t sass me.
*END_CHOICE
*CHOICE
*PROTAG, curious
Actually, I only drink water.


*ANNABEL, content
That’s unusual, but staying hydrated is important!


*NARRATOR
Annabel grabs a cup, fills it with ice water and hands it to you.


*PROTAG, laughing
H2O on the rocks!


*ANNABEL, laughing
Enjoy!

*BGM: Urgent_1


*NARRATOR
While you and Annabel enjoy your morning drinks, the television suddenly flashes red.


A “BREAKING NEWS” marquee crawls across the screen.


News Anchor: This just in! A commuter train has just derailed after colliding with a delivery van!


*PROTAG, scared
*ANNABEL, scared
Oh, no...


*NARRATOR
The TV shows aerial footage of a flipped delivery van on fire and train cars scattered amongst broken glass and metal debris.


News Anchor: No reports of injuries or fatalities have been released yet as emergency help is currently on the way. 


News Anchor: Stay tuned in to Channel 1 Charm City News to get the latest details on this crazy train crisis as it breaks.


*PROTAG, serious
*ANNABEL, sad
I take that train for my commute!
I would have been one of those passengers less than an hour ago...


*PROTAG, 5, surprised
*ANNABEL, 4, surprised
*NARRATOR
The door to the break room bursts open.


*HOLIDAY, 2
Mrs. Lee. PROTAG.


*NARRATOR
Dr. Holiday’s eyes briefly glance at the TV and the scenes of the wreckage before turning back to you.


*HOLIDAY, angry
Well? What are you waiting for, rookie?


*ANNABEL, serious
*PROTAG, serious
Yeah. No time to waste. Let’s go!

*CUTSCENE
*BG: Hospital_Garage
*BGM: Urgent_1


*NARRATOR
You follow Annabel to the garage, rushing through the winding hallways and down a flight of stairs.


Despite your heavy breathing and lactic acid build up in your legs, you push on. Lives are at stake. Every moment counts.


*ANNABEL, 2
Here it is! This is our ride.


*NARRATOR
Annabel leads you to a sleek and modern ambulance, nothing like the big, box-shaped wagons you are familiar with.


There is a holographic flame decal the runs along the front and the sides of the ambulance like something out of a cheesy action movie.


*PROTAG, 3, confused
This looks more like a sports car than an ambulance.


*ANNABEL, smug
Looks more like an overgrown toy than a sports car if you ask me.


*NARRATOR
As you and Annabel approach, the doors swing open vertically and you get in: it's much more spacious inside than you were expecting.


*BGM: Dante_1
*PROTAG, neutral
*ANNABEL, neutral
*DANTE, 4
Welcome aboard “The Inferno,” the fastest emergency response vehicle on four wheels.


*NARRATOR
You get into the passenger seat and lock into the race car-like seat belt harness.


*ANNABEL
This is Dante Hachiroku. He’s our fastest and most skilled EMT.


*PROTAG, curious
*ANNABEL, unimpressed
*DANTE, winking
Don’t forget most handsome!


*DANTE, curious
...and you are?


*PROTAG
PROTAG. I’m the new intern surgeon working under Dr. Holiday.


*DANTE, intrigued
Oh, so you’re the new kid Holiday was making a fuss over…


*DANTE, smug
Well, let’s see whatcha got!


*PROTAG, startled
*ANNABEL, startled


*NARRATOR
Dante presses several buttons, pulls the stick shift into gear and peels out of the Hospital’s garage.


*BG: Highway_1
*BGM: Dante_2


*ANNABEL
WOAH!


*PROTAG, curious
*ANNABEL, resigned


*NARRATOR
Dante reaches up to grab a radio microphone, clicks the button in with his thumb and begins talking to you and Annabel, even though you are only several inches apart.


*DANTE, laughing
Ladies and gentlemen and everyone in-between, this your captain speaking. 


*PROTAG, concerned
*ANNABEL, startled


*NARRATOR
Dante fluidly adjusts gears while driving at breakneck speed, weaving between cars on the busy highway.


*DANTE, happy
Welcome aboard Inferno Flight 420 with service from back there to over there.


We ask you to keep your seatbelt fastened at all time because there’s going to be turbulence en route to the emergency site.


*PROTAG, startled
*ANNABEL, scared


*NARRATOR
Dante jerks the wheel and sharply drifts around a corner, wheels screeching.


The air is filled with the smell of burnt rubber before coming to a complete stop.


*PROTAG, exhausted
*ANNABEL, exhausted
I think we finally made it...


*DANTE, laughing
Thank you for choosing Dante’s Inferno, the fastest emergency response vehicle on four wheels.


*NARRATOR
Dante puts the radio microphone away and the side doors flip open revealing the twisted wreckage of the crash.


*DANTE, confident
It’s showtime, kiddo!

William was found beneath some debris at the wreckage site from earlier today.


We performed X-Rays earlier and found that William’s ribs have been broken and he may be suffering from internal hemorrhages.


Be sure to remove any blood that pools as it will obstruct your view of any procedures that must be done.
